# algorithms-practice
This repository will contain all of the algorithms I have studied and practiced. I will also use different languages to implement them, usually Java and Python. 

The goal is to reinforce my understanding of the algorithms and data structures I have learned and store it in long-term memory so I can easily recall and use what I need when I need it.

It's also a way to display how much I know, but be mindful that this of course is updated gradually and does not include everything I know. 

Each file will contain the following:
- Purpose of the algorithm
- Function (how the algorithm works)
- Best Use Cases
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- My Code
- Testing Examples
